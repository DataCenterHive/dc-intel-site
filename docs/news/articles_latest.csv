As data pipelines expand and model complexity grows, teams can find themselves spending more time orchestrating distributed compute than building the intelligence that powers their products. Scaling from a laptop experiment to a production-grade workload still feels like reinventing the wheel. What if scaling AI workloads felt as natural as writing in Python itself? That’s the idea behind Ray, the open-source distributed computing framework born at UC Berkeley’s RISELab, and now, it’s coming to Azure in a whole new way.
