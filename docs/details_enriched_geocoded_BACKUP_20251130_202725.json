In an area dotted with modest restaurants and stores, the server farms resemble aircraft carriers dropped onto the landscape.",

Construction of the second phase is currently under way and will add an additional twelve Turn-Key Flex Data Centers, bringing the total to 22. The Turn-Key Flex Suites are designed with cooling technology that allows for the use of outside air economization to increase efficiency and decrease PUE. The facility is situated on a secure campus protected by perimeter fencing, manned guard gates, berms and hard-scaping. Each building has a single, main entry point protected by card key access and a 24x7x365 guard station. Additional security is provided by CCTV and biometric access controls. HVAC, Power and building critical systems are managed and monitored 24x7x365 by highly trained Digital Realty employees. The Ashburn campus is powered by 80 MW from the Greenway Substation which is located on Digital Realty\u2019s property. The construction of a second dedicated substation, the Enterprise Substation, also located on Digital Realty\u2019s property was constructed and completed in early 2014. This brings the total capacity of the Digital Ashburn campus to 230MW. Power is distributed to each building via dedicated underground, concrete encased duct banks. The power is provided by one of the most reliable transmission systems in the country with reduced risk of electrical interruptions and rates that are below the national average.",

Our data center also provides a customer workspace area. Our Sacramento data center provides flexible colocation options including the partial cabinet, full cabinet, and customized cage space. Our data center provides raised floor space for subfloor cable management and efficient airflow. Our data center is regularly audited in accordance with SSAE 16 SOC I requirements and can help clients achieve compliance with Sarbanes Oxley, HIPAA, PCI DSS, FED banking regulations, and many other standards. Our data center provides multiple layers of security such as video surveillance of indoor and outdoor areas, 24x7x365 secured access and monitoring, and entrance to the facility is restricted through key card access. The facility uses FM 200 fire suppression system for extinguishing any fire spark and is equipped with VESDA control for early detection of smoke particles. Our Sacramento data center provides a reliable N+1 power infrastructure. An immediate power failure is protected by a UPS system in N+1 redundancy in the event there was a loss of utility power. The emergency power to the data center is fed through N+1 redundant diesel generators with fuel storage onsite in the event of a prolonged power outage. The automatic transfer switch (ATS) switches the power to diesel generators on sensing the utility power failure and transfer back the load on the restoration of the main supply. The data center provides both AC and DC power circuit to each cabinet. The cooling and humidity in the data center are maintained through HVAC units in N+1 redundant configuration for the optimum performance of all hardware components.",

Our data center is a state of the art facility providing a redundant, reliable, and fault tolerant infrastructure to host modern day applications. Our data center also provides a customer workspace area. Our data center provides flexible colocation options in Las Vegas including the partial cabinet, full cabinet, and customized cage space. Our data center provides raised floor space for subfloor cable management and efficient airflow. Our data center is regularly audited in accordance with SSAE 16 SOC I requirements and can help clients achieve compliance with Sarbanes Oxley, HIPAA, PCI DSS, FED banking regulations, and many other standards. Our data center provides multiple layers of security such as video surveillance of indoor and outdoor areas, 24x7x365 secured access and monitoring, and entrance to the facility is restricted through key card access. The facility uses FM 200 fire suppression system for extinguishing any fire spark and is equipped with VESDA control for early detection of smoke particles. Our data center provides a reliable N+1 power infrastructure. Immediate power failure is protected by a UPS system in N+1 redundancy in the loss of utility power. Emergency power to the data center is fed through N+1 redundant diesel generators with fuel storage onsite in the event of a prolonged power outage. The automatic transfer switch (ATS) switches the power to diesel generators on sensing the utility power failure and transfer back the load on the restoration of the main supply. Our data center provides both AC and DC power circuit to each cabinet. The cooling and humidity in the data center are maintained through HVAC units in N+1 redundant configuration for the optimum performance of all hardware components.",
